# AI Brain Core Module: Technical Specifications and Implementation Blueprint

## Executive Summary and Objectives

The AI Brain Core module is the central orchestrator for context, knowledge, reasoning, and output quality in agentic systems. It defines the contracts, data flows, and control planes that enable multiple specialized components—graphStore, expansionController, retrieval system, term disciplinarian, formalizer, and steelman/red-team agents—to collaborate coherently and safely at scale. Its remit spans six surfaces: conversational context management; coordination and orchestration patterns; a unified interface for organizing, brainstorming, and writing; quality and provenance tracking; natural language processing (NLP) integration; and error handling with fallbacks.

The architecture is intentionally pattern-driven and event-aware. It provides:

- A conversational context management system that captures turns, episodes, and artifacts, with context lifecycles governed by summarization, window-aware policies, and memory handoffs. This ensures continuity while bounding cost and latency, aligning with established agent orchestration guidance[^1].
- Component coordination mechanisms using proven patterns—sequential, concurrent, group chat, handoff, and magentic orchestration—selected by task characteristics, with rigorous isolation and interface contracts. This draws on industry best practices for multi-agent system design and production hardening[^1].
- A unified interface for three primary modes—organize, brainstorm, write—with capability discovery, mode negotiation, and policy-driven execution, all surfaced through a compact, pragmatic API and schema.
- Quality and provenance tracking through a provenance-first event model spanning data, models, agents, and outputs, with integrated quality scores, thresholds, and auditability compatible with agentic provenance research[^7][^8].
- Natural language processing integration options balancing prebuilt services and Spark NLP pipelines, with lifecycle and deployment practices informed by MLflow and Spark-based patterns[^2][^16][^17][^18][^19][^20][^21].
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms—timeouts, retries, circuit breakers, hedging, and degraded modes—plus controlled resumption through checkpoints, supporting rainbow deployments for stateful agents[^1].

Non-goals: The module intentionally omits vendor-specific tool integrations, UI/UX mockups, and domain-specific configuration values that will be provided at deployment time.

Success will be measured by functional correctness, measurable quality uplift (e.g., citation accuracy, hallucination reduction), acceptable latency and cost envelopes, resilience under failure, and auditability across all major decision points.

To provide a concise overview of the system’s surface areas and operational boundaries, the following register enumerates the core capabilities and their operational scope.

## System Context and Core Components

The AI Brain Core module operates within an agentic ecosystem where multiple specialized components collaborate to produce trustworthy outputs. It interacts with upstream clients (applications or user interfaces) that issue task requests and receive responses; memory subsystems for short- and long-term persistence; NLP services and pipelines; and external tool providers for search, retrieval, evaluation, and verification.

### System Architecture Overview

![AI Brain Core Module - System Architecture Overview](/workspace/charts/ai_brain_core_architecture.png)

The architectural diagram above shows the complete AI Brain Core module structure with all major components and their relationships. The system follows a hierarchical design with the AI interface at the top orchestrating specialized agents and services through a sophisticated coordination engine.

The core components and their roles are:

- graphStore: A knowledge graph that stores entities, relationships, and provenance links for retrieval, reasoning, and citation. It exposes commit and query interfaces and supports incremental updates and caching.
- expansionController: Determines when to broaden or narrow the search or reasoning scope. It manages budget-aware expansion and contraction of queries, agents, and tools based on quality signals, timeouts, and target recall.
- retrieval system: Indexes documents and artifacts, supporting dense and sparse retrieval, reranking, and freshness/filters. It integrates with graphStore for entity-aware augmentation and returns provenance along with results.
- term disciplinarian: Enforces a project glossary, style and compliance constraints, and consistent term usage. It provides suggestions and auto-normalization decisions under policy control.
- formalizer: Converts an outline and context into structured drafts, generating sections, citations placeholders, and notes.
- steelman/red-team agents: Challenge the draft, surface counterarguments, identify missing evidence, and apply a rubric for quality checks. They provide structured issues and risk scores and can trigger revisions.
- context manager: Maintains conversation state, episodes, artifacts, and memory. It orchestrates summarization and memory handoffs to manage context window pressure while preserving continuity[^1].
- orchestrator: Routes tasks across components using orchestration patterns; enforces timeouts, retries, circuit breakers; and coordinates quality gates and provenance logging[^1].

Dependencies are explicit: all cross-component communication follows interface contracts with schemas and error codes. Isolation boundaries reduce blast radius: no shared mutable state is allowed across concurrent agents; coordination avoids shared single points of failure. When state must be shared, event sourcing plus append-only provenance logging ensures auditability and recovery.

To frame responsibilities and lifecycles, the following register provides component-level summaries.

Table 2. Component responsibility register: responsibilities, inputs, outputs, dependencies, and lifecycle hooks

| Component | Responsibilities | Inputs | Outputs | Dependencies | Lifecycle Hooks |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Orchestrator | Pattern selection, delegation, aggregation | Task descriptors, policies | Delegations, aggregated results | All components | init, route, timeout, retry, aggregate, log_provenance |
| ContextManager | Turn state, episodes, summaries, memory handoffs | Turns, artifacts, models | Context snapshots, summaries | graphStore (optional), ProvenanceLogger | on_turn, on_episode_end, summarize, checkpoint |
| graphStore | Entity/relationship persistence, provenance links | Entities, relations | Query results, graph diffs | ProvenanceLogger | on_commit, on_query, cache_invalidate |
| RetrievalSystem | Index/search/rerank with filters | Queries, filters | Ranked results + provenance | graphStore (entity hints), NLPAdapter | on_query, on_drift, cache_warm |
| expansionController | Budget-aware expansion, contraction signals | Quality signals, timeouts | Expansion/contract decisions | Orchestrator, RetrievalSystem | on_check_quality, on_timeout, adjust_budget |
| TermDisciplinarian | Glossary/style enforcement | Text spans, policy | Suggestion events, normalized text | ProvenanceLogger | on_text_span, enforce_policy |
| Formalizer | Outline-to-draft conversion | Outline, context | Structured draft, notes | RetrievalSystem, TermDisciplinarian | on_outline, on_section, on_citation_placeholder |
| Steelman/RedTeam | Critique, counterargument, rubric scoring | Draft, criteria | Issues, risk score | ProvenanceLogger | on_draft, evaluate, recommend_revision |
| ProvenanceLogger | Entity/event capture and storage | Event payloads | Immutable provenance records | All components | on_event, on_audit, on_reconstruct |

### Component Communication and Interaction Flows

![AI Brain Core Module - Component Interaction Flows](/workspace/charts/ai_brain_interaction_flows.png)

The interaction flow diagram above illustrates the sequential processing pipeline when the AI Brain Core receives a request. The system demonstrates parallel processing capabilities with concurrent execution of graph queries, retrieval operations, and term analysis, followed by structured formatting and quality assessment.

### Context and Memory Management Architecture

![AI Brain Core Module - Context and Memory Management](/workspace/charts/ai_brain_context_memory.png)

This diagram provides a detailed view of the conversational context management system, showing how conversation history, working memory, episodic memory, and long-term knowledge are organized and managed through hierarchical structures.

## Conversational Context Management System

Conversational context is the backbone of coherent agent behavior. The module maintains a structured state model encompassing:

- Sessions: Boundaries that group related interactions over a period; they provide continuity and allow configurable retention policies.
- Turns: Atomic exchanges with timestamps, speaker roles (user, system, agent), content, and attached tool artifacts (retrieval results, generated figures, or code).
- Episodes: Groupings of turns that represent coherent phases (e.g., “research,” “drafting,” “review”). Episodes are natural points for summarization and checkpoints.
- Artifacts:离散 outputs such as retrieval result sets, normalized term lists, draft sections, or evaluation notes. Artifacts can be stored in specialized stores (filesystem, object storage) with references in context.
- Summaries: Salient facts and decisions extracted from episodes and artifacts; they are used to bound token usage while preserving continuity[^1].

Context lifecycle policy: When context window pressure or cost thresholds are reached, the ContextManager produces summaries, prunes low-salience turns, and moves completed work to external memory. Fresh subagents can be spawned with clean contexts and fed concise instructions plus references to persisted artifacts. Handoffs preserve continuity by attaching brief summaries and memory pointers to agent inputs, a practice recommended to maintain long-running agent coherence[^1]. This approach complements dialogue management patterns found in modern conversational systems that emphasize context-aware state transfer and streaming continuity[^3][^4].

Memory handoffs: Prior to spawning a fresh agent or handing off to a new component, the ContextManager extracts highlights (key findings, decisions, unresolved issues), attaches glossary deltas (new or corrected terms), and includes pointers to artifacts. The target agent receives a compact instruction set with references, avoiding re-running expensive steps.

Summarization strategy: Summaries are structured to maximize utility under token constraints. They include highlights, decisions, open questions, and citations (source references with positions). Recency bias is mitigated by preserving milestone events and anchoring critical facts in artifacts that are referenced rather than fully inlined.

To illustrate how context state evolves across operations, the following table lists the canonical fields.

Table 3. Context state fields and lifecycle: session_id, episode_id, turn_id, artifacts, summary, window metrics, retention policy

| Field | Description | Lifecycle Notes |
|---|---|---|
| session_id | Unique identifier for the session | Set on session start; persists across episodes |
| episode_id | Identifier for the current episode | Created at episode start; closed on milestone |
| turn_id | Incremental identifier per turn | Unique within session; monotonic |
| artifacts | References to external outputs | Created by components; immutable after commit |
| summary | Structured salient facts and decisions | Updated at episode milestones; pruned on window pressure |
| window_metrics | Token counts, turns count, artifact size | Tracked per turn; triggers summarization thresholds |
| retention_policy | Configured durations and privacy constraints | Applied per session/episode; overrides in degraded modes |

Summarization triggers must be explicit, predictable, and tied to operational SLOs. The policy register below defines triggers and actions.

Table 4. Summarization triggers and actions: thresholds, prioritized content types, and summarization depth

| Trigger | Threshold | Prioritized Content | Summarization Depth | Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Token window pressure | ≥ configured token limit | Milestones, decisions, citations | High (compact) | Summarize and prune low-salience turns |
| Episode milestone | Explicit episode close | Highlights, open questions | Medium | Produce episode summary; archive artifacts |
| Cost budget near-limit | ≥ configured budget fraction | Expensive tool outputs | Selective | Replace raw artifacts with references |
| Latency target risk | Approaching P95 latency SLO | Recent turns | High | Summarize recent turns; delay non-critical artifact expansion |
| Privacy constraint | On sensitive data | Sensitive spans | Strict | Redact and summarize without raw content |

### Context Contracts and Schemas

Consistent context structures are essential for reliability. The module defines minimal JSON schemas for turns and episodes. Schemas are versioned and forward-compatible, enabling evolution without breaking producers and consumers.

Example JSON schema for a turn:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "required": ["session_id", "episode_id", "turn_id", "timestamp", "role", "content"],
  "properties": {
    "session_id": { "type": "string" },
    "episode_id": { "type": "string" },
    "turn_id": { "type": "integer", "minimum": 0 },
    "timestamp": { "type": "string", "format": "date-time" },
    "role": { "type": "string", "enum": ["user", "system", "agent"] },
    "content": { "type": "string" },
    "artifacts": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": {
        "type": "object",
        "required": ["artifact_id", "type", "uri"],
        "properties": {
          "artifact_id": { "type": "string" },
          "type": { "type": "string", "enum": ["retrieval_result", "term_delta", "draft_section", "evaluation_note"] },
          "uri": { "type": "string" },
          "provenance_ref": { "type": "string" }
        }
      }
    },
    "window_metrics": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "token_count": { "type": "integer" },
        "artifact_size_bytes": { "type": "integer" }
      }
    },
    "summary": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "highlights": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" } },
        "decisions": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" } },
        "citations": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" } }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Versioning strategy: All schemas include a version string (e.g., "context.turn.v1"). Backward compatibility is maintained through optional fields and defaulting; breaking changes trigger a new version and migration path. Producers must set the schema version; consumers reject unknown major versions or apply adapter logic when permitted.

### Summarization and Memory Handoff Procedures

Summarization follows a structured approach:

1. Identify milestones: decisions, key findings, unresolved questions, and citation anchors.
2. Extract highlights: compress long artifact descriptions into concise references with salient descriptors.
3. Preserve provenance: record summary generation events, sources, and any normalization actions.
4. Build memory pointers: for artifacts, include URIs and provenance references; avoid embedding large content.

When context limits approach, the ContextManager spawns fresh agents with clean contexts and attaches memory pointers to enable continuity. Handoffs are crafted as brief instruction sets including goals, constraints, and artifact references. This practice aligns with production guidance for long-running agent processes where truncation risks loss of state, and summarized memory plus references mitigate that risk[^1].

## Component Coordination Mechanisms

Orchestration is the means by which the AI Brain Core composes specialized components into reliable workflows. The module supports five canonical patterns—sequential, concurrent, group chat, handoff, and magentic—selected based on task characteristics, determinism, and resource constraints[^1][^5][^6].

- Sequential orchestration chains components in a deterministic pipeline. It is ideal for progressive refinement (outline → draft → critique → polish) and where each step adds a specific transformation.
- Concurrent orchestration runs multiple specialized components in parallel (fan-out/fan-in), useful for breadth-first exploration, ensemble analysis, and reducing latency.
- Group chat orchestration enables collaborative debate or maker-checker loops, managed by a chat manager; it provides transparency and auditability with an accumulating conversation thread.
- Handoff orchestration routes work dynamically to the most suitable component, transferring full control; it is suitable for complex multi-domain tasks where specialization emerges during processing.
- Magentic orchestration (manager-led, task ledger) is used for open-ended problems without a predetermined plan; the manager agent builds and refines a dynamic ledger of goals and subgoals, delegating to specialized agents and backtracking as necessary[^1].

To help teams choose the right pattern, the matrix below maps task properties to recommended orchestration modes.

Table 5. Orchestration pattern selection matrix: task properties vs recommended patterns, with pros/cons

| Task Properties | Recommended Pattern | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|---|
| Linear dependencies, deterministic | Sequential | Clear control, predictable quality gates | Potential latency; limited exploration |
| Parallelizable, time-sensitive | Concurrent | Low latency, breadth of analysis | Higher cost; aggregation complexity |
| Collaborative debate, transparency | Group chat | Auditability, human oversight | Risk of Loops; discussion overhead |
| Dynamic specialization | Handoff | Flexible routing, expertise fit | Routing errors; bouncing loops risk |
| Open-ended, plan-building | Magentic | Dynamic planning, backtracking | Slow planning; higher cost |

Interfaces are strict: component contracts define method names, inputs, outputs, error codes, and timeouts. The interface contract register enforces consistency.

Table 6. Interface contract register: method, input schema, output schema, error codes, timeout budget

| Method | Input Schema | Output Schema | Error Codes | Timeout Budget |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| retrieve | {"query": "string", "filters": "object"} | {"results": ["object"], "provenance": "object"} | RETRIEVAL_TIMEOUT, INDEX_UNAVAILABLE | 400 ms P95 |
| expand_scope | {"signal": "object", "budget": "number"} | {"decision": "string", "rationale": "string"} | EXPANSION_BLOCKED, POLICY_DENIED | 150 ms P95 |
| enforce_terms | {"text": "string", "policy": "object"} | {"suggestions": ["object"], "normalized_text": "string"} | POLICY_CONFLICT | 200 ms P95 |
| formalize_outline | {"outline": "object", "context": "object"} | {"draft": "object", "notes": ["string"]} | FORMALIZE_INPUT_INVALID | 1 s P95 per section |
| critique | {"draft": "object", "rubric": "object"} | {"issues": ["object"], "risk_score": "number"} | CRITIQUE_TIMEOUT | 800 ms P95 |
| log_provenance | {"event": "object"} | {"status": "string"} | LOGGER_UNAVAILABLE | 100 ms P95 |

### Event Bus and Message Schema

Events are the connective tissue of the system. A typed event bus distributes context updates, retrieval results, term normalization suggestions, draft publication, and evaluation outputs. Events include correlation IDs and causal links to reconstruct provenance and debug flows.

Example event payload schemas:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "required": ["event_type", "correlation_id", "timestamp", "payload"],
  "properties": {
    "event_type": { "type": "string", "enum": ["context.updated", "retrieval.completed", "term.suggestion", "draft.published", "evaluation.completed"] },
    "correlation_id": { "type": "string" },
    "timestamp": { "type": "string", "format": "date-time" },
    "causal_link": { "type": "string" },
    "payload": { "type": "object" }
  }
}
```

Routing and retry policies are defined per event type. Idempotency keys ensure at-least-once delivery does not cause duplicate effects. Dead-letter queues capture unprocessable events for inspection and replay.

### Routing and Capability Discovery

Agents and components advertise capabilities and cost profiles via a registry. The Orchestrator uses this registry to select the best component given task requirements, timeouts, and budget constraints. When deterministic routing is needed (e.g., compliance checks), it applies predefined rules; when flexibility is required, it uses capability metadata and recent performance signals to choose. This approach aligns with design pattern guidance on choosing agentic patterns and maintaining deterministic control where necessary[^1].

## Unified Interface Design: Organize, Brainstorm, Write

The unified interface exposes three modes, each designed for a class of tasks and bound by clear policies:

- Organize mode: Structures existing information—documents, notes, and artifacts—into outlines, taxonomies, or knowledge graphs. It invokes retrieval, term discipline, and graphStore commits. Its outputs include structured outlines and graph diffs.
- Brainstorm mode: Generates diverse ideas and hypotheses, often through concurrent orchestration, with term disciplinarian constraints to avoid drift. It invokes expansionController and multiple retrieval/search agents in parallel, aggregating results with conflict resolution.
- Write mode: Converts an outline into a structured draft, inserts citation placeholders, and runs steelman/red-team critique before emitting the final text. It enforces terms and quality gates before publishing.

The interface is minimal and consistent. It supports capability discovery, mode negotiation, and policy-driven execution. The register below outlines capabilities per mode.

Table 7. Operation catalog by mode: inputs, outputs, preconditions, postconditions, and error surfaces

| Mode | Operation | Inputs | Outputs | Preconditions | Postconditions | Error Surfaces |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Organize | Build outline | Artifacts, retrieval results | Outline object | Retrieval available | Graph diff committed | RETRIEVAL_TIMEOUT, COMMIT_FAILED |
| Organize | Graph commit | Entities, relations | Commit receipt | Schema valid | Provenance logged | SCHEMA_INVALID, LOGGER_UNAVAILABLE |
| Brainstorm | Generate ideas | Goal, constraints | Idea set | Expansion allowed | Terms applied | EXPANSION_BLOCKED, TERM_POLICY_CONFLICT |
| Brainstorm | Aggregate | Idea set | Ranked list | Conflict resolution policy | Provenance recorded | AGGREGATION_ERROR |
| Write | Formalize | Outline, context | Draft sections | Glossary loaded | Citation placeholders added | FORMALIZE_INPUT_INVALID |
| Write | Critique | Draft, rubric | Issues, risk score | Draft finalized | Revision recommended/released | CRITIQUE_TIMEOUT |
| Write | Publish | Final draft | Release receipt | QA gates passed | Audit trail complete | PUBLISH_DENIED |

### API and Schema Definitions

A compact, pragmatic API serves all modes. It uses JSON for requests and responses, with pagination for large outputs and streaming for partial results when latency must be minimized.

Endpoints:

- POST /context/snapshot: Create a context snapshot for current session/episode.
- POST /context/summarize: Trigger summarization with given depth and priorities.
- POST /retrieve: Query retrieval system with filters.
- POST /expand: Signal expansionController to broaden or narrow scope.
- POST /terms/enforce: Apply glossary and style policies to a text span.
- POST /formalize: Convert outline to draft sections.
- POST /critique: Run steelman/red-team evaluation against a rubric.
- POST /provenance/log: Append a provenance event.

Example request/response for formalize:

Request:

```json
{
  "outline": {
    "title": "AI Brain Core Specification",
    "sections": [
      { "heading": "Context Management", "points": ["State model", "Summarization triggers"] },
      { "heading": "Orchestration", "points": ["Patterns", "Contracts"] }
    ]
  },
  "context_ref": "session:abc,episode:123"
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "draft": {
    "sections": [
      { "heading": "Context Management", "content": "...", "citations": ["src:docX#pos45"] },
      { "heading": "Orchestration", "content": "...", "citations": ["src:docY#pos12"] }
    ]
  },
  "notes": ["Ensure provenance linked for each section"]
}
```

Error codes include standard categories (input invalid, timeout, policy denied, dependency unavailable). All endpoints return a correlation_id for tracing and a schema version for compatibility.

## Natural Language Processing Integration

NLP is integrated through a pluggable adapter that can route tasks either to prebuilt services (e.g., Azure AI Services) or to Spark NLP pipelines, depending on scale, cost, and customization requirements[^2][^16][^17][^18][^19][^20][^21]. The adapter provides:

- Preprocessing: sentence detection, tokenization, normalization.
- Annotations: named entity recognition, classification, summarization.
- Embeddings: sentence/document embeddings for retrieval augmentation.
- Offline/batch processing: Spark NLP pipelines for large-scale documents and corpora.

Model selection balances latency, cost, and capability. For high-level tasks such as entity recognition, sentiment, or summarization where prebuilt models suffice, Azure AI Services offer quick integration with broad language coverage. For custom pipelines or large-scale processing, Spark NLP pipelines provide extensibility and performance at scale, with integration into MLflow for lifecycle management[^2][^17][^18][^20][^21].

The following matrix guides selection by task.

Table 8. NLP capability matrix: task -> recommended model/pipeline, latency/cost expectations, and fallback options

| Task | Recommended Model/Pipeline | Latency/Cost | Fallback |
|---|---|---|---|
| NER (generic) | Prebuilt entity recognition (Azure AI Services) | Low latency, moderate cost | Spark NER if custom entities |
| Keyphrase extraction | Spark NLP pipeline (TF/IDF + annotators) | Moderate latency, scalable | Prebuilt service for small texts |
| Summarization | Prebuilt summarization API | Low latency, per-call cost | Spark pipeline with embeddings + extractive steps |
| Classification | Custom Spark NLP classifier | Training cost, batch inference | Prebuilt classification for common labels |
| Language detection | Prebuilt language detection | Low latency, low cost | Spark detection for unusual corpora |
| Embeddings | MPNet embeddings via Spark NLP | Moderate cost, batch generation | External embedding service |

### Spark NLP Pipeline Composition

Spark NLP pipelines follow a structured flow: DocumentAssembler → SentenceDetector → Tokenizer → Normalizer → optional Embeddings → task-specific annotators (e.g., NER, classification). Pipelines operate on DataFrames and scale across clusters. They can be registered and tracked with MLflow, enabling versioned deployments and reproducibility[^17][^18][^20].

Example pipeline skeleton (Python-like pseudocode):

```python
from sparknlp.base import DocumentAssembler
from sparknlp.annotator import SentenceDetector, Tokenizer, Normalizer
from sparknlp.annotator import WordEmbeddings
from sparknlp.annotator import NerDLApproach  # example for NER

document_assembler = DocumentAssembler().setInputCol("text").setOutputCol("document")
sentence_detector = SentenceDetector().setInputCols(["document"]).setOutputCol("sentences")
tokenizer = Tokenizer().setInputCols(["sentences"]).setOutputCol("tokens")
normalizer = Normalizer().setInputCols(["tokens"]).setOutputCol("normalized")
embeddings = WordEmbeddings().setInputCols(["normalized"]).setOutputCol("embeddings")
ner = NerDLApproach().setInputCols(["embeddings", "tokens"]).setOutputCol("ner")

pipeline = Pipeline(stages=[
  document_assembler,
  sentence_detector,
  tokenizer,
  normalizer,
  embeddings,
  ner
])

# MLflow tracking
mlflow.start_run()
mlflow.spark.log_model(pipeline, "spark_nlp_pipeline")
mlflow.end_run()
```

For translation, spell checking, or advanced text normalization, annotators are selected based on corpus characteristics and language coverage[^2][^18].

## Quality and Provenance Tracking Implementation

Provenance is a first-class concern in the AI Brain Core. The module records a comprehensive set of entities and events across data, models, agents, tasks, and outputs. Events conform to a W3C-PROV-inspired model adapted for agent interactions and model invocations, ensuring traceability and reproducibility[^8][^7].

Core entities:

- DataItem: raw or processed data artifact (document, retrieval result).
- Model: versioned model artifact (pipeline, API).
- Agent: an actor with capabilities and identity.
- Task: unit of work with inputs and outputs.
- Output: produced artifact with quality assessments.
- Evaluation: quality judgments and rubric scores.

Key events:

- GeneratedBy: links outputs to the agent(s) and model(s) that produced them.
- Used: links data items and tools used in a task.
- DerivedFrom: links outputs to source data or prior outputs.
- EvaluatedWith: links outputs to evaluation events and rubrics.

The provenance event register below standardizes payloads and retention.

Table 9. Provenance event register: event types, required fields, source component, and retention policy

| Event Type | Required Fields | Source Component | Retention Policy |
|---|---|---|---|
| GeneratedBy | output_id, agent_id, model_ref, timestamp | Orchestrator, Formalizer | Append-only; long-term |
| Used | task_id, data_item_ids, tool_ids | Orchestrator, RetrievalSystem | Append-only; long-term |
| DerivedFrom | output_id, source_ids | Formalizer, graphStore | Append-only; long-term |
| EvaluatedWith | output_id, rubric_id, scores | Steelman/RedTeam | Append-only; audit period |
| ContextSnapshot | session_id, episode_id, summary_ref | ContextManager | Medium-term; privacy-aware |
| GraphCommit | graph_diff_id, entities, relations | graphStore | Long-term; immutable |

Quality assessment is integrated with provenance. LLM-as-judge evaluates outputs against a rubric with metrics such as factual accuracy, citation accuracy, completeness, source quality, and tool efficiency; scores are stored and linked to outputs[^1]. Thresholds trigger gates—critique cycles, term discipline corrections, or publishing blocks—if quality is insufficient.

Table 10. Quality rubric and thresholds: metric definitions, scoring ranges, and gating rules

| Metric | Definition | Score Range | Threshold | Gate Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Factual accuracy | Degree of correctness in claims | 0.0–1.0 | ≥ 0.8 | Allow publish |
| Citation accuracy | Correctness and availability of citations | 0.0–1.0 | ≥ 0.9 | Block publish; request revision |
| Completeness | Coverage of required sections and points | 0.0–1.0 | ≥ 0.85 | Allow with notes |
| Source quality | Authority and reliability of sources | 0.0–1.0 | ≥ 0.7 | Trigger retrieval enhancement |
| Tool efficiency | Minimal tool usage within budget | 0.0–1.0 | ≥ 0.6 | Allow; monitor cost |

### Event Model and Serialization

Canonical event schemas are versioned and stored in append-only logs. Reconstruction procedures enable replay of workflows from provenance records, useful for audits and debugging. The serialization registry defines field names, types, and versions.

Table 11. Canonical event schema registry: event name, fields, types, and version

| Event Name | Fields | Types | Version |
|---|---|---|---|
| GeneratedBy | output_id, agent_id, model_ref, timestamp | string, string, string, date-time | v1 |
| Used | task_id, data_item_ids, tool_ids | string, array, array | v1 |
| DerivedFrom | output_id, source_ids | string, array | v1 |
| EvaluatedWith | output_id, rubric_id, scores | string, string, object | v1 |
| ContextSnapshot | session_id, episode_id, summary_ref | string, string, string | v1 |
| GraphCommit | graph_diff_id, entities, relations | string, array, array | v1 |

## Error Handling and Fallback Mechanisms

Multi-agent systems are susceptible to cascading failures, timeouts, and non-determinism. The AI Brain Core applies standard reliability patterns with agent-specific nuances[^1]:

- Timeouts and retries: per component, with backoff and jitter to avoid thundering herds. Idempotency keys ensure safe retries.
- Circuit breakers: prevent repeated calls to failing dependencies; fallback strategies are applied on open circuits.
- Hedging: send speculative requests to reduce latency tail; cancel redundant requests once results arrive.
- Graceful degradation: fall back to cached results, reduced precision models, or narrower search breadth when budgets or timeouts are tight.
- Degraded modes: prioritize essential outputs, defer non-critical expansions, and operate under tighter quality thresholds.
- State recovery: checkpoints and resumable workflows enable continuation from the last stable point; rainbow deployments are used to migrate stateful agents safely[^1].

The playbook below codifies actions by error class.

Table 12. Error handling playbook: error class -> detection signals -> actions -> escalation paths

| Error Class | Detection Signals | Actions | Escalation Path |
|---|---|---|---|
| Timeout | P95 exceeded, request age | Retry with backoff; hedge | Notify Orchestrator; consider degraded mode |
| Dependency unavailable | Circuit open | Fallback to cache; reduce scope | Alert ops; open incident |
| Policy violation | Term disciplinarian denied | Correct terms; re-run | Escalate to compliance |
| Retrieval drift | Quality drops | Expand sources; rerank | Trigger retrieval tuning |
| Quality gate fail | Rubric score below threshold | Critique loop; revise draft | Notify owner; block publish |

Fallback matrices identify primary and secondary options for common dependencies.

Table 13. Fallback matrix: primary dependency -> secondary option -> criteria -> cost/latency impact

| Primary | Secondary | Criteria | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| Dense retrieval | Sparse retrieval + rerank | High precision needed | Slightly higher latency |
| Prebuilt summarization | Extractive pipeline | Budget constraints | Lower cost, possible quality loss |
| Large model | Small model + caching | Timeout risk | Lower latency, reduced depth |
| Graph commit | Memory-only diff | Logger unavailable | Temporarily reduced auditability |
| Concurrent analysis | Sequential analysis | Cost ceiling near | Lower cost, higher latency |

### Degraded and Safe Modes

Degraded modes are activated under specific triggers: budget exhaustion, timeouts, or privacy constraints. They maintain safe functionality by narrowing scope and emphasizing essential outputs, minimizing cost and risk. For example, under budget pressure, the module reduces concurrent breadth, caches reusable results, and defers non-critical expansions while preserving quality gates for publish actions.

## Class Diagrams and Code Examples

This section outlines the primary classes, their relationships, and exemplar code for core flows. Class responsibilities and methods are designed to align with orchestration patterns and interfaces described earlier.

Table 14. Class responsibility summary: class name, key methods, input/output schemas, collaborators

| Class Name | Key Methods | Input/Output Schemas | Collaborators |
|---|---|---|---|
| Orchestrator | route(task), aggregate(results) | Task descriptor / Aggregated outputs | All components |
| ContextManager | on_turn(turn), summarize(), handoff() | Turn JSON / Snapshot | ProvenanceLogger |
| RetrievalSystem | retrieve(query), rerank() | Query JSON / Ranked results | NLPAdapter |
| ExpansionController | expand(signal), contract(budget) | Signal / Decision | Orchestrator |
| TermDisciplinarian | enforce(text, policy) | Text span / Suggestion events | ProvenanceLogger |
| Formalizer | formalize(outline, context) | Outline / Draft sections | RetrievalSystem, TermDisciplinarian |
| SteelmanAgent | critique(draft, rubric) | Draft / Issues + risk score | ProvenanceLogger |
| ProvenanceLogger | log(event) | Event payload / Status | All components |
| EventBus | publish(event), subscribe(handler) | Event / Handler | Orchestrator |

### Context Manager and Memory Store

ContextManager maintains session/episode state, performs summarization, and orchestrates memory handoffs.

Minimal TypeScript interface:

```typescript
interface ContextManager {
  onTurn(turn: Turn): Promise<ContextSnapshot>;
  summarize(episodeId: string, depth: "low" | "medium" | "high"): Promise<Summary>;
  handoff(episodeId: string, targetAgentId: string): Promise<InstructionSet>;
}

interface Turn {
  session_id: string;
  episode_id: string;
  turn_id: number;
  timestamp: string;
  role: "user" | "system" | "agent";
  content: string;
  artifacts?: ArtifactRef[];
  window_metrics?: { token_count: number; artifact_size_bytes: number };
}

interface Summary {
  highlights: string[];
  decisions: string[];
  citations: string[];
}

interface InstructionSet {
  goal: string;
  constraints: string[];
  artifacts: ArtifactRef[];
  summary: Summary;
}
```

### Orchestrator and Event Bus

Orchestrator implements pattern selection, delegation, and aggregation, backed by an event bus for typed message delivery.

Simplified interfaces:

```typescript
interface Orchestrator {
  route(task: TaskDescriptor): Promise<AggregatedOutput>;
  timeoutPolicy(): TimeoutPolicy;
  retryPolicy(): RetryPolicy;
  aggregate(results: Result[]): AggregatedOutput;
}

interface EventBus {
  publish(event: Event): Promise<void>;
  subscribe(eventType: string, handler: (event: Event) => Promise<void>): void;
}

interface TaskDescriptor {
  pattern: "sequential" | "concurrent" | "group_chat" | "handoff" | "magentic";
  steps: StepDescriptor[];
  budget?: Budget;
  qualityGates?: QualityGate[];
}

interface StepDescriptor {
  component: string;
  method: string;
  input: object;
  timeout?: string;
}
```

## Security, Privacy, and Observability

Security and privacy are enforced across the module:

- Identity propagation: The user’s identity and entitlements are propagated across agents, applying security trimming and least privilege to ensure agents can only access data permitted for the user[^1].
- Audit trails: All agent operations and handoffs are instrumented for troubleshooting and compliance. Provenance logs provide a comprehensive record of what was produced, by whom, and using which data and models[^1][^8].
- Observability: Metrics, logs, and traces are collected per operation and aggregated by workflow. Performance baselines and resource usage are tracked to identify bottlenecks and optimize cost[^1].
- Governance: Access controls and data minimization reduce risk; privacy constraints inform retention policies and redaction strategies. Sensitive data is redacted before summarization when required.

To make observability concrete, the module defines a metrics catalog.

Table 15. Metrics catalog: metric name, source component, unit, aggregation, and SLO target

| Metric Name | Source Component | Unit | Aggregation | SLO Target |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Request latency (P95) | Orchestrator | ms | percentile | ≤ target per operation |
| Token usage per session | ContextManager | tokens | sum | ≤ budget |
| Retrieval recall@k | RetrievalSystem | ratio | avg | ≥ baseline |
| Term enforcement precision | TermDisciplinarian | ratio | avg | ≥ target |
| Quality gate pass rate | Orchestrator | ratio | percentage | ≥ target |
| Error rate by class | Orchestrator | ratio | percentage | ≤ threshold |
| Provenance completeness | ProvenanceLogger | ratio | percentage | ≥ target |

## Testing, Evaluation, and Rollout

Testing spans unit, integration, and multi-agent workflow levels. Early evaluations focus on a representative sample of queries to detect dramatic impacts of prompt and policy changes. Agents and workflows are tested for correctness, robustness under failure, and alignment with quality gates[^1].

LLM-as-judge is used for free-form outputs, employing rubrics and scoring that align with human judgments. It enables scalable evaluation with pass/fail thresholds and numeric scores. Human evaluation remains essential for edge cases, subtle biases, and system failure modes[^1].

Rollout uses rainbow deployments to migrate traffic gradually for stateful agents without disrupting running processes. Checkpoints and resumability ensure continuity when interruptions occur[^1].

The evaluation rubric defines metrics and thresholds.

Table 16. Evaluation rubric: metric, definition, scoring method, and thresholds

| Metric | Definition | Scoring Method | Thresholds |
|---|---|---|---|
| Factual accuracy | Correctness of statements | LLM-as-judge 0–1 score | ≥ 0.8 pass |
| Citation accuracy | Correct citation presence and location | LLM-as-judge 0–1 score | ≥ 0.9 pass |
| Completeness | Coverage of required sections | 0–1 score | ≥ 0.85 pass |
| Source quality | Authority of sources | 0–1 score | ≥ 0.7 pass |
| Tool efficiency | Resource usage relative to budget | 0–1 score | ≥ 0.6 pass |

Rollout plan checklist:

Table 17. Rollout plan checklist: preconditions, canary criteria, rollback conditions, and observability checks

| Phase | Preconditions | Canary Criteria | Rollback Conditions | Observability Checks |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Shadow | Schema locked; tests green | Latency within P95 | Error rate spike | Traces complete |
| Canary | Baseline metrics stable | Quality pass rate ≥ target | Quality drop ≥ threshold | Metrics align |
| Progressive | No anomalies across sessions | Token usage within budget | Latency P95 exceeds target | Event logs complete |
| Full | All gates met | Stability across episodes | Provenance gaps | Audit trails complete |

## Assumptions and Information Gaps

To implement the AI Brain Core module, several specifics must be provided at deployment time:

- Programming language and runtime preferences (e.g., TypeScript/Node.js, Python/FastAPI, Java/Spring).
- Deployment environment and networking constraints, including model providers, quotas, and region strategies.
- Data stores for long-term memory (e.g., graph database, document store) and their exact schemas.
- Security requirements (PII handling, data residency, encryption standards, and compliance frameworks).
- Performance SLOs (latency targets, token budgets, throughput) and cost ceilings per operation.
- Quality thresholds (acceptable hallucination rates, citation accuracy targets) and evaluation rubrics.
- Provenance retention and audit requirements (immutability guarantees, cryptographic sealing).
- Glossary sources, style guides, and normalization policies for term disciplinarian.
-具体orchestration topology (sequential vs concurrent vs handoff/magentic) per use case.

These gaps should be resolved in a design review before implementation begins.
