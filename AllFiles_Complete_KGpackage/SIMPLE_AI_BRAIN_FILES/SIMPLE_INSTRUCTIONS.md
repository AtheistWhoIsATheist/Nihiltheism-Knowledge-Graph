# SIMPLE AI BRAIN UPLOAD - NO CONFUSION

## What you have: 9 files total

### STEP 1: Create these 3 folders on GitHub
Go to: https://github.com/AtheistWhoIsATheist/Nihiltheism-Knowledge-Graph

Click "creating a new file" and create these folders:
1. `src/core/`
2. `src/routes/`
3. `src/components/`

### STEP 2: Copy files to their correct locations

**FILES TO CREATE IN src/core/ folder:**
- `ai_brain.py` ← copy content from file "ai_brain.py"
- `context_manager.py` ← copy content from file "context_manager.py"  
- `provenance_tracker.py` ← copy content from file "provenance_tracker.py"

**FILES TO CREATE IN src/routes/ folder:**
- `ai_brain.py` ← copy content from file "routes_ai_brain.py" (different file!)

**FILES TO CREATE IN src/components/ folder:**
- `AIBrainChat.jsx` ← copy content from file "AIBrainChat.jsx"

**FILES TO CREATE IN docs/ folder:**
- `AI_BRAIN_DOCUMENTATION.md` ← copy content from file "AI_BRAIN_DOCUMENTATION.md"

### STEP 3: Replace existing files

**Replace these files in your repository:**
1. `main.py` ← copy content from file "main.py"
2. `App.jsx` ← copy content from file "App.jsx" 
3. `requirements.txt` ← copy content from file "requirements.txt"

### STEP 4: Done!

That's it! Only 9 files to work with.
